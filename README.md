# Emoji Snippets
## TextExpander + Emoji = 💚

Because you want to use Emoji *everywhere*, like me. Because you love [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) and are always looking for more snippets...

Clone the repo to download. Or curl. Or whatever you feel most comfortable with.

Snippets follow conventions found at [Emoji Cheat Sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/): they *should* match one-for-one with Github emoji (in most cases). For example, `:smiley:` or `:poop:`.

A huge shoutout to diy's [NSStringEmojize](https://github.com/diy/nsstringemojize), which I cannibalized in order to quickly grab all of the emoji and return them in TextExpander format. This would have taken 50x longer without it.
